# Sales Data Cleaner (ETL Pipeline)


## 1. Project Title & Goal
This project cleans a messy sales CSV file and converts it into structured JSON data using a Pandas-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline.

## 2. Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or above

### Steps to Run 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## 3. The Logic (How I Thought)

a. Why did I choose this approach?

As an AI/DS student, I understand that data preprocessing is the most critical step in any machine learning pipeline. I chose Pandas because it is the industry-standard library for data cleaning and transformation, especially when working with larger datasets. Pandas enables efficient, readable, and scalable data processing through vectorized operations.

b. What was the hardest bug you faced, and how did you fix it?

One issue I faced was handling CSV headers while converting price values to float. Pandas was trying to cast the header string as data. I fixed this by explicitly handling the header and cleaning the column before type conversion.
