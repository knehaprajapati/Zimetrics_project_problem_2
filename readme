1. Project Title & Goal:
This project cleans a messy sales CSV file and converts it into structured JSON data using a Pandas-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline.

2. Setup Instructions:

- Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or above

- Steps to Run 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```


3. The Logic (How I Thought):

- Why did I choose this approach?

As an AI/DS student, I understand that data preprocessing is the most critical step in any machine learning pipeline. I chose Pandas because it is the industry-standard library for data cleaning and transformation, especially when working with larger datasets. Pandas enables efficient, readable, and scalable data processing through vectorized operations.

- What was the hardest bug you faced, and how did you fix it?

One issue I faced was handling CSV headers while converting price values to float. Pandas was trying to cast the header string as data. I fixed this by explicitly handling the header and cleaning the column before type conversion.

5. Future Improvements:  If I had two more days, I would:

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand price distributions and country-wise sales patterns.

- Using a larger historical dataset, this cleaned data can be used to train a regression model (such as Linear Regression) to predict future sales or revenue trends.
